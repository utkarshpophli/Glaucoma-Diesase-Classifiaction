# Glaucoma-Diesase-Classifiaction

The diagnosis and classification of diseases, such as glaucoma, are critical tasks in the field of medical imaging. Leveraging advancements in computer vision and deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offers promising avenues for accurate disease classification. This document delves into the application of CNNs for the classification of glaucoma, exploring their effectiveness in automating the diagnosis process and aiding healthcare professionals in timely interventions.


## Libraries Used:

* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib


## About the Dataset:

The datset provided by zenodo.org contained 101K images. In This Notebook, i'm using a part of the dataset mainly 17K images containing both classes: "referable glaucoma" or "no referable glaucoma."
## Results

Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we assess the performance of CNN-based models in glaucoma disease classification. The results highlight the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the models in distinguishing between healthy and glaucomatous retinal images. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts in leveraging deep learning for improving disease diagnosis and management, with potential implications for enhancing healthcare outcomes in ophthalmology.
